# Converge app

[Demo available here](https://maoredman.github.io/converge-app)

### Description
A web app for filtering objects ("FulfillMe"s) with selected criteria.
<br>
For example:
 - Finding a restaurant which is ("cheap" or "my favorites")
 - Selecting all your preferred courses, and see which master's degrees they point to

A great tool for facilitating efficient decision-making!

### How to run
`npm install`, then `npm start`
